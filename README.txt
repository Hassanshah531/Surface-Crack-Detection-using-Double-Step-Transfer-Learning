This work aims at developing a machine learning-based model to detect cracks on concrete surfaces. Such model is 
intended to increase the level of automation on concrete infrastructure inspection when combined to unmanned 
aerial vehicles (UAV).
We use double step transfer learning techniques. Two different datasets are used at two Sequential
phases in training. Resnet50 is used for surface crack detection.
